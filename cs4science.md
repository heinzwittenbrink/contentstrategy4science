# Science does not take place in content strategy

## Content strategy takes place ROI-, not evidence-driven

# Science communication campaigns usually take place without a content strategy

## Sender-oriented communication models

> Readers will come away with an enhanced understanding that there is no 'silver bullet' to communications about climate change; instead, a 'silver buckshot' approach is needed, where strategies effectively reach different audiences in different contexts.

## Pre-digital publication understanding

## Orientation towards traditional channels of publicity

[PIK in the Media - Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/pik-in-the-media "PIK in the Media - Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research")

## Scientific publishing opens up to the web only in small steps

# Content strategy is not the same as communication strategy

## Communication on the net is user-centred

# Search

## Communication on the net works holistically

## Communication on the net works depending on technical platforms

## State of knowledge and evidence synthesis

## State of knowledge as the centre of a content strategy for science

## Connection possibilities to scientific evidence synthesis

## Medical information as an example

# Scientific community as content provider

## Scientific knowledge as knowledge of the scientific community

> „much of what we identify as “science” are social practices and procedures of adjudication designed to ensure—or at least to attempt to increase the odds—that the process of review and correction are sufficiently robust as to lead to empirically reliable results“

Naomi Oreskes. „Why Trust Science?.“ 

> „The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—now one of the world’s largest aggregations of scientists—makes a particular point of seeking geographical, national, racial, and gender diversity in its chapter-writing teams. “

Naomi Oreskes. „Why Trust Science?.“  

## Trust in the scientific community as a condition and goal of a content strategy for science

> „It is a call for informed trust in the consensual conclusions of scientific communities, but not necessarily in the views or opinions of individual scientists, particularly not when they stray outside their domains of expertise.“

Naomi Oreskes. „Why Trust Science?.“ 

# Advocacy and Propaganda

> I interrogate different approaches to climate advocacy, and animate their promises and pitfalls in the context of highly politicized deliberations on climate change in the public sphere. Nested in here, I argue that the conflation of these advocacy approaches between Type I advocacy (advocacy for [scientific] evidence) and Type II advocacy (advocacy for policy outcomes) contributes to confusion, apolitical intellectualism and excessive restraint that then increases the prevalence of Type 0 advocacy. Type 0 advocacy as inaction is then effectively a form of action. 

## Content strategy for science must connect to existing framing

>  We all make sense of the world through cultural and political lenses. This also applies to editorials that make sense of science in and for the world. Given that climate change has become an issue through which some groups and individuals define themselves, it is important to determine how perceptions of self, other and climate change are at least partially shaped by high-level editorial opinion pieces and how they, in turn, may be shaped by the culture in which they are written and the personalities who write them. 

Nerlich, B. (2018). Climate change through an editorial lens. Nature Climate Change, 8(6), 459–460. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0179-9

## It brings its objects into the social discourse and is thus also partisanship
> Also, the fossils of the science community are those who feel their work is done once they have done the field research, and have written up and published their findings. It is soothing to take that view. Yet more is needed to discharge substantive engagement. Through dialogue and creativity via additional ways of knowing and learning about climate change, we can enlarge possibilities for effective (climate) communication (see Chapter 4 for more). Similarly, information-deficit model approaches can be overcome through a sustained commitment to meeting people where they are through more creative and dialogical processes.

# Practical contexts

## Content strategy for science is not simplification but translation for non-scientific contexts

## Examples: Health, political decisions, products

## It takes place dialogically

> The growing emphasis on ‘knowledge co-production’ (iterative engagement with diverse knowledge holders to produce knowledge relevant to decision-making), was evident in many cases (eg SESYNC, SNAPP, Peatlands Inquiry). This approach rests on the assumption that more relevant, and therefore more useful knowledge will be produced if it is done so in collaboration with those who will use it.

# Different depths of penetration

## Scientific results must be made as accessible as possible

[Warming stripes | Climate Lab Book](https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2018/warming-stripes/ "Warming stripes | Climate Lab Book")

## They must take into account different contexts

## They must be adapted to practical use situations

# Transparency

## Links with original publications must be traceable

[Global Temperature Report for 2020 - Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/global-temperature-report-for-2020/ "Global Temperature Report for 2020 - Berkeley Earth")

## Linking takes place with everything relevant to the state of research
[State of the climate: 2020 on course to be warmest year on record](https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-2020-on-course-to-be-warmest-year-on-record "State of the climate: 2020 on course to be warmest year on record")

## Empathy

## Consideration for users includes understanding their emotional situations

[Reed College | Reed Magazine | Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore](https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2018/elizabeth-rush-rising-excerpt.html "Reed College | Reed Magazine | Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore")

## Empathic communication also communicates the dimensions and relevance of scientific content.

## Public responsibility and non-scientific authorities

## Content strategy for science takes place beyond the boundaries of scientific space

## Glaubwürdigkeit der Information kann deshalb mit außerwissenschaftliche Quellen unterstrichen werden

# Summary 

Content strategy 4 science transfers the user-oriented, holistic digital first approach of the Content Strategy to the life cycle of scientific content. It is understood as the content of a scientific community through which this community interacts with the public and stakeholders. The content adapts to its users through dialogue.
